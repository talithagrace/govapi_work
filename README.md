<p>Scraping information from government websites. Information is scraped from www.gov.uk as well as www.legislation.gov.uk. 
More websites will be added over time as necessary.</p>
<p>Users can enter a search term in order to bring up a list of announcements, consultations and legislation relating to this search term.
Results are presented in the form of a table.</p>
<p>Users can click on the '+' sign at the top of the web page to bring up a list of current open consultations</p>
<p>More work to be done to iterate over multiple pages of search results on the Government websites</p>
<p> I hope that this app will be used to facilitate more participation in UK democracy by presenting key information in an accessible,
clear way</p>
